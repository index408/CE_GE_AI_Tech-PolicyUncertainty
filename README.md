## Carbon Emissions, Green Energy, Artificial Intelligence and High-Tech Policy Uncertainty of China: Overview

To construct the policy uncertainty indices, we followed a rigorous process based on "Measuring Economic Policy Uncertainty" by Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016). First, core economic keywords were selected to ensure article relevance. Then, domain-specific keyword lists were compiled through literature reviews of academic studies, policy documents, and industry reports in carbon emissions, green energy, high-tech, and AI. Input from domain experts validated these keyword sets. Policy and uncertainty terms were derived from Baker et al.’s framework but translated and tailored to Chinese linguistic and policy contexts. Data were sourced from the People’s Daily and Guangming Daily (2000–2023), chosen for their authority and wide influence, making them reliable indicators of policy shifts and market sentiment.

Search queries used a three-tiered keyword approach to filter for articles referencing economic terms (e.g., “economy” and “market”), sector-specific topics (e.g., “carbon peak,” “carbon neutrality,” “renewable energy,” “semiconductors”), uncertainty (e.g., “uncertain” and “fluctuations”), and policy (e.g., “regulations”). Regular expressions matched keywords in article text, and monthly frequencies were calculated. Z-scores were applied to standardize scale differences, and the Hodrick–Prescott filter extracted long-term trends while smoothing short-term fluctuations. Final indices were normalized to a [0, 100] scale.
